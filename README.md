# Getting Started with Lucenia

This repository is designed to help you get started with Lucenia. It will contain several different sub-repositories, each with its own specific capabilities and documentation.

## Repositories

### 1. Lucenia Core
The first repository will start Lucenia itself. It will include all the necessary files and configurations to get Lucenia up and running. This repository will contain its own README file with detailed instructions on how to set up and use Lucenia.

### 2. STAC Catalog API
The second repository will contain a product that can be used to insert STAC catalog documents into Lucenia. This product will be run using FASTAPI and will also have its own README.

Each sub-repository can be ran separately and sequentially in their own containers.
